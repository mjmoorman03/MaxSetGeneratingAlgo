# MaxSetGeneratingAlgo

Algorithm to generate maximal rotational sets given a single rotational orbit efficiently. 

Based on the paper by John C. Mayer, Michael Moorman, Gabriel Quijano, and Matthew "Hugh" C. Williams Jr. concerning counting maximal rotational sets of Julia sets. Algorithm was created by Williams (https://github.com/HughMCWJR) and edited by Moorman.

Naturally, the input to the MaxSetGeneratingGenerating() function will need to be changed accordingly, but the functions contained within algorithm.py ought not to be changed.
